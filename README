Static files built with rails. Added default devise authentication.
	Problems to note:
	- Slider javascript on root fails when accessed via back button.
	- Routing issues with password reset page
		- Error: 'No route matches [GET] "/users/sign_in"' [fixed!]
	To do:
	- Enable mailer via Mandrill for password resets [fixed!]
	- Add jekyll based events and bible study pages (important!)
	- Find suitable location for search field
	- Match up active link states
	- Make flash and error states presentable
	- Add account page

To run locally, you'll need the environment variables. Let me know when you need them.
