        <h4>Ashok Prakash</h4><h6>Vice President</h6>
        <p>I've been at Trinity since 2006. I've been involved with the music aspect of worship (in both the choir and worship team) and decided to take on the VP position in order to help guide our youth. I don't do this alone however... I have a great committee that is always willing do to what's best for our youth fellowship. Looking forward to recording some music with the world famous Jay Mathew!</p>

        <h4>Betsy Alexander Zachariah</h4><h6>Secretary</h6>
        <p>I think I would be able to describe myself best as a small town girl. I'm awkward and shy at times but outgoing and bubbly the next. I'm blessed to be surrounded by an amazing group of family and friends and am amazed at how much God has entrusted me with and hope to use all my  efforts for his glory. I've only been a member of Trinity Marthoma Church for 2 years now and am absolutely loving it thus far.</p>

        <h4>Teena Thomas</h4><h6>Joint Secretary</h6>
        <p>My position requires me to be at all the meetings and assist the secretary with her responsibilities. This is my second year on the committee, and it’s definitely the best year! Being a part of the Youth Fellowship has allowed me to branch out and put myself in a position where I'm able to connect with my fellow youth, while also working on my relationship with Christ!</p>

        <h4>Jay Mathew</h4><h6>Senior Advisor</h6>
        <p>I like long walks on the beach.... my bad Ivan’s looked like a biodata for Shaddi.com! :) I've been at TMC since the day I was born, born and raised, on the playgrounds I spent most of my days. Chillin out maxin' relaxin' all cool (hopefully you got this joke by now...) I am one of the Senior Advisors for YF this year, probably the youngest Senior Advisor in YF history.  I don’t know how much advice I have really passed along but what I do know is that I love this YF and am dedicated to do whatever I can to help the youth of our Church grow in Christ and with one another.</p>

        <h4>Stacy George</h4><h6>Senior Advisor</h6>
        <p>Greetings from one of your friendly senior advisors! Through this ministry, I pray that God grants me the strength to live a life that honors Him. "Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven."</p>
