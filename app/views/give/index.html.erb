		<h3>Give Money</h3>
		<div class="give-m-body">The Youth Fellowship accepts donations, large or small, to help fund the events we have planned for the year. The Bible asks us to give our first and our best back to God and He will bless the rest. Get us touch with us at <a href="mailto:hello@tmcyf.org">hello@tmcyf.org</a> or see an officer during church.</div>

		<h3>Give Time</h3>
		<div class="give-t-body">It's very easy. Volunteer at our service events. We challenge our youth to take their faith and service past the comforts of our church and go to the places where Christ’s love may not be well seen. When you hear about an upcoming service event, consider joining us as we give back to the community and embody the love of Christ. Also, if you're in need of volunteer hours for school, we will fill out the necessary paperwork to make your hours count.<br>Have some neat volunteer ideas? Give us a shout over at <a href="mailto:service@tmcyf.org">service@tmcyf.org</a>.</div>
