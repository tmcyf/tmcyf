		<h3>Give Time</h3>
		<div class="give-t-body">It's very easy. Volunteer at our service events. We challenge our youth to take their faith and service past the comforts of our church and go to the places where Christ’s love may not be well seen. When you hear about an upcoming service event, consider joining us as we give back to the community and embody the love of Christ. Also, if you're in need of volunteer hours for school, we will fill out the necessary paperwork to make your hours count.<br>Have some neat volunteer ideas? Give us a shout over at <a href="mailto:service@tmcyf.org">service@tmcyf.org</a>.</div>
